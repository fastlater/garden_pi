# garden-pi
Automated watering and gardening system using the Raspberry Pi


The design is very simple, targeting small container gardening. Planed support for the following hardware:
* 4 watering/gardening zones
* 4 GPIO based Relays
* 4 GPIO based capacitive water (R/C circuit)
* 1 GPIO based capacitive light sensor (R/C circuit)
* 5 One-wire Dallas temperature sensors
* CSV logging of data
* Charting of data using Flask/matplotlib/pandas
* Keep infrastucture simple
